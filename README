This is a data analysis project evaluating the twitter activity revolving around a polarizing event:
the Oprah Winfrey interview with Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

Context:
The social media landscape is rife with hot button topics, toxic rhetoric, and immeasurable humor. Few topics (on my timeline at least)
are more polarizing than opinions surrounding Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. Earlier this year the couple recorded an exclusive
interview with Oprah Winfrey.


Tasks:
Clean the dataset - most problematic is the location, twitter allows users to supply their own location; some classic hits: Planet Earth, D(M)V, Buckeye Nation, etc.
Perform exploratory analysis - size and shape of the data set, determine what variables I will need to create, etc.
Main analysis - sentiment analysis, eventually: sentiment over time, account authenticity, top accounts, top tweets, top hashtags, activity location
Visualization - create a visually appealing dashboard using Tableau
Report - compile the final analysis and visualizations into a pdf report that summarizes the findings.

Pending:
I want to update this project so that it's less cumbersome to evaluate. The output from the parsing of the hashtags/mentions take up significant space and technically contribute
very little if anything to the analysis.
